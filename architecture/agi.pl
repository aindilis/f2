# do we run a main loop?  how does its metabolism work?

# a UTM is too general, we require something similar though, with more
# code for interaction and learning, etc

# model the learner as something that interacts with its environment

# it has a set of actions it knows how to perform

# it learns by developing actions

# it has a set of observations, represented using Coslor's picform

# it experiments with different inferences

# it can observe certain parts of its memory

# we need some process that as it executes, effectively stores memory,
# and retrieves memory based on experience

# actions happen if certain conditions are met
# this can be modelled implicitly

# the actions must modify the state of the system somehow

# certain streams are examined by other parts of the architecture,
# and those parts can feel free to modify the data with their
# observations
