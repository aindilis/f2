develop the ai
find a stable place to stand
improve the life conditions across the world

# write a core agent that has its own goals, and see what it can do

# probably want to write an agent that has its own goal language

# the tools that I have affect how I can develop

# none of the systems out there are capable of understanding complex
# ideas, why is that?  that's a semantics problem right there.  These
# ontologies are rather useless, as they only address certain
# contexts.  Maybe picform is necessary after all.

# there is no completion to this process at present

# how to find completion



# contextual imagination

# suppose this to be true, what happens


# analogical reasoning



# pattern recognition




# goals, will, etc.

# complex search with backtracking

# feedback and interaction

# pain and sensitivity

# the reaction to pain must be an inevitable one, it should inflict
# damage against its goals

# even its goals must be weighed intellectually

# this is part of the womb


"It should learn operators"
"It needs to be able to observe to learn operators"
"These operators should be used to achieve its goals"
"Observation consists of pattern recognition"
"It should model systems in its mind"
"It should have an ability to visualize things"
"It needs to react negatively when its goals are impaired"
"It needs to be aware when I am affecting its goals"

# how does observation take place?
# entity modelling?

observation is not a function call, it is an interaction between the
environment and the object. we need to define the object, and how it
reacts to changes from the environment.

we need to create a few living organisms first
