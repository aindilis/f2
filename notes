The information leads to this, that the brain is kind of like a
programmer, and as things are learned, the brain finalizes its
programs.

Therefore, to implement a general purpose learner...

Should have the ability to speak, should learn that by learning to run
code that does the speech synthesizer.

When parents criticize a child they have difficulty.



<REDACTED:RANT>

Maybe I should implement my task management system.

Need a goal language?


Lets focus on the task management system.


The planner has to be generated from learning, in fact.  Planning rules must be learned.

The fact is there are only a few things to be learned.

The question is how to write software that could learn to plan, among other things.

Maybe write a program that learns programming.  Maybe write a learner
that observes computing execution.




An imagination.  A system for learning rules and predictions about the
environment, which can be used to reason about things.

Have a contextual learner like Justin's.

Have a set of real world problems.

Suppose that in situation A I perform action B.

What are the differences between the measured situation, and the theoretical situation.


Maybe the human mind has a strong representation.

If I get up and walk over somewhere, I can imagine what that will be
like.  I imagine it in a sequence of images, and also the motor things.

Notice how I can see what I am thinking and make observations about my
own thought.  Therefore, the search program should be able to examine
itself in relation to it.

I can examine a singular point such as my arm and rotate around it,
etc.  Perhaps this system needs to be able

That's the search program.  It's the interconnectedness of the
knowledge.
